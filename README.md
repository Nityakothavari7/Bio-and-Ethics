## PREDICTION OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SEVERITY USING BIOMARKERS AND BLOCKCHAIN

## Problem Statement
Autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involve multiple biomarkers like cytokines and immune cell markers. RA diagnosis and treatment strategies often depend on subjective clinical evaluations, leading to treatment delays. So, there’s a need to develop a model to predict RA severity and to suggest treatment strategies.

## Proposed Solution
To develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which allows the users to input the biomarker levels which can predict the severity of RA using a Machine learning algorithm and suggest treatments. We will be integrating Blockchain technology into our project for data privacy.

## Dataset Acquisition
The datasets were taken from the NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) and hence their respective accession IDs are given here

1. GSM1068616 - IL-10
2. GSM993402 - IL-17
3. GSM993406 - TNF-Alpha 
4. GSM258773 - CD4+
5. GSM211514 - IL-6

## Methodology
First, 
Pre-processing of the data was done using MinMaxScaler in Python
